OpenCenRev stands for Open Censore Revelation. An app designed to remove many kinds of censore from media.
It should use AI model trained on data from media which were approved by their authors to be used in this project.
No other type of data is allowed.
This project utilises Godot 4.3-stable as UI base; Python 3.12.? as AI base.
This decision requires to have a Godot Plugion for Python support. Such plugin for Godot 4.3-stable is not yet available.
Therefore wait for release or make own custom Plugin.
